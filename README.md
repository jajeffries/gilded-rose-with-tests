# Gilded Rose Exercise

This is originally from the wonderful work by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). If you want to go deeper into learning about legacy code, this is a great place to start.

In this version of the exercise we have some code and a set of which provide some code coverage. We need to add a crucial new feature for the business to stay ahead of the competition.

Luckily whoever worked on this last left their requirements document and some notes in the repo so have a look at the [GildedRoseRequirements.md](GildedRoseRequirements.md) document.

## Getting started

You can run the tests using
```
make test
```

This will run the tests and produce a code coverage report in `cover/index.html`. You can also regenerate it and open it using
```
make results
```

## Todo
[] Work out why branch coverage isn't working
[] Add tests to get better branch coverage, especially around backstage passes
